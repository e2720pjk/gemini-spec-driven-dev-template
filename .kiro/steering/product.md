# Product Goals

This project, the "Gemini CLI," serves as a template for "spec-driven development." Its primary purpose is to facilitate a "guidance-centric development mode" where "documentation is truth."

The core objectives are to ensure:
- **Consistency:** Maintain a uniform approach across development tasks.
- **Maintainability:** Promote code and documentation that are easy to understand and update.
- **High Quality:** Encourage robust and well-documented solutions.

The project aims to provide a structured framework for interacting with the Gemini CLI, emphasizing clear processes and adherence to documented guidelines.
