# Technology Stack

This project primarily leverages the following technologies:

-   **Gemini CLI:** The core platform for executing commands and interacting with the system.
-   **Markdown (`.md`):** Used extensively for documentation, command definitions, and steering documents.
-   **TOML (`.toml`):** Utilized for configuration files, particularly within the `.gemini/commands/` directory for defining command parameters.
-   **Git:** For version control and project management.

The project itself does not appear to contain traditional application code (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java) or associated package management systems (e.g., npm, pip, Maven). Its focus is on defining and managing interactions within the Gemini CLI environment through structured documentation and configuration.
